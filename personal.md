## Coda

I want to simplify filmmaking tools so anyone can apply the grammar of the film language to express themselves on film as deftly as anyone can apply the written word to express themselves on a page.

## Where I've failed

*Quick Note: Personal websites like this are meant to showcase achievements that are built on failures. By sharing where I've failed, I hope to contribute to an environment of reducing the amount of shame people, including myself, feel towards themselves. This section is an homage to my late cousin, [Courtney Brousseau](https://courtneybrousseau.github.io). 🍍*

### Research
In a past life, I did research in quantum computing, studying quantum algorithms for simulating quantum field theories. I spent two years in my lab with exceptional mentors and while I learned a lot, the premise for joining was I'd produce a publication. This never happened. After discovering my current research, I made the painful decision of leaving that lab, my work unpublished and unfinished. My work now is more aligned with my passions and that is reflected in my output. However, even when I did submit my first paper for publication, Toon3D—it was rejected. This was crushing. The experience softened me, further alleviating external stresses and bolstered the "eat your vegetables" advice of focusing on long-term growth and learning. I'm happier for it. 

### Admissions
I was not admitted to UC Berkeley, amongst most other schools I applied to, as a freshman. As rejections often are, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I spent two erudite years at Santa Barbara City College, where my foundations in higher level physics, mathematics, and writing were sculpted by stellar professors who cared a great deal about teaching. It is only because of their intellectual nurture I can approach problems in my work now with confidence.
