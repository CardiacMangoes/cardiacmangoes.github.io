*Enjoying a savory pastry from [The Cheese Board Bakery](https://cheeseboardcollective.coop)*

Hi! I'm a Research Assistant at [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu) working with [Angjoo Kanazawa](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa/) and [Alyosha Efros](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/) on projects in qualitative 3D, with a flair for film and animation. If you'd like to see the movies that have shaped me, check out my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/CardiacMangoes/). :)

Always happy to chat, and I am currently looking for opportunities in industry starting Fall 2024, so if you're interested in working with me please reach out!
