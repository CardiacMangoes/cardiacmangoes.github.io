*Enjoying a savory pastry from [The Cheese Board Bakery](https://cheeseboardcollective.coop)*

Hi! I'm a Research Assistant at [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu) working with [Angjoo Kanazawa](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa/) and [Alyosha Efros](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/) on projects in qualitative 3D, with a flair for film and animation.

Always happy to chat, and I am currently looking for opportunities in industry starting Fall 2024, so if you're interested in working with me please reach out! If you'd like to see the movies that have shaped me, connect with me on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/CardiacMangoes/). :)
