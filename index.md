*Enjoying a savory pastry from [The Cheese Board Bakery](https://cheeseboardcollective.coop)*

Hi! I'm a researcher and engineer who is currently working on creative tooling with a startup in Hollywood. 

Before this, I studied Computer Science and Physics at UC Berkeley. I was a Research Assistant at [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu) where I had the pleasure of working with [Angjoo Kanazawa](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa/) and [Alyosha Efros](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/), and [Ren Ng](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/yirenng.html) on projects in computer vision, neuroscience, and colorimetry. My research aspires to understand computational perception; studying how our eyes capture light, process it as visual information, and transform it into art ‚Äî with downstream applications for filmmaking and animation. 

If you'd like to see the movies that have shaped me, check out my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/CardiacMangoes/). :)

Always happy to chat, feel free to reach out about movies/cameras/research/color/whatever!

## Where I've failed

*Quick Note: When everything you see in others is their success, the contrast can cause imposter syndrome as one can assume failure is unique to you. This is never true. By sharing where I've failed, I hope to contibute to an environment of reducing the amount of shame people, including me, feel towards themselves for their failures. This section is an homage to my late cousin, [Courtney Brousseau](https://courtneybrousseau.github.io). üçç*

### Research
In a past life, I did research in quantum computing, studying quantum algorithms for simulating quantum field theories. I spent two years in my lab with exceptional mentors and while I learned a lot, the premise for joining was I'd produce a publication. This never happened. After switching to my current research, I came to the painful decision of leaving something unfinished that I started. I'm more passionate about what I work on now and that is reflected in my output. However, even when I did submit my first paper for publication, Toon3D, it was rejected. This was crushing. The experience softened me, further alleviating external stresses and bolstered the "eat your vegetables" advice of focusing on long-term growth and learning. I'm happier for it. 

### Admissions
I was not admitted to UC Berkeley, amongst most other schools I applied to, as a freshman. As rejections often are, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I spent two erudite years at Santa Barbara City College, where my foundations in higher level physics, mathematics, and writing were sculpted by stellar professors who cared a great deal about teaching. It is only because of their intellectual nurture I can approach problems in my work with confidence.
